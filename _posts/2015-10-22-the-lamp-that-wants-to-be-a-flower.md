description: "This clever design might seem a little obvious, but it's actually quite thoughtful! The BLUM lamp's floral inspiration is apparent in its form, but it also takes inspiration from living plant's energy process. Set the plant by the window, and solar panels harvest the sun's energy to power the bright LED lights."
